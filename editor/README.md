# evalvana-editor

`evalvana-editor` is a basic, WIP, multi-line text input widget for `iced`, based on the single-line text input in `iced_native`. `evalvana-editor` is a separate crate to make licensing clear; `iced_native` is under MIT, and so this portion of Evalvana is licensed under MIT as well, as it is a derivative of work done there.
